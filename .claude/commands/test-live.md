### Pre-Test Setup

1. **Environment Verification**
   - Verify basic-memory is installed and accessible via MCP
   - Check version and confirm it's the expected release
   - Test MCP connection and tool availability

2. **Recent Changes Analysis** (if phase includes 'recent' or 'all')
   - Run `git log --oneline -20` to examine recent commits
   - Identify new features, bug fixes, and enhancements
   - Generate targeted test scenarios for recent changes
   - Prioritize regression testing for recently fixed issues

3. **Test Project Creation**

Run the bash `date` command to get the current date/time. 

   ```
   Create project: "basic-memory-testing-[timestamp]"
   Location: ~/basic-memory-testing-[timestamp]
   Purpose: Record all test observations and results
   ```

Make sure to switch to the newly created project with the `switch_project()` tool.

4. **Baseline Documentation**
   Create initial test session note with:
   - Test environment details
   - Version being tested
   - Recent changes identified (if applicable)
