Here are the most relevant results:

    {{#each results}}
        {{#if_cond (lt @index 5)}}
        {{#dedent}}
            ## {{math @index "+" 1}}. {{ title }}
            - **Type**: {{ type.value }}
            {{#if metadata.created_at}}
            - **Created**: {{date metadata.created_at "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"}}
            {{/if}}
            - **Relevance Score**: {{round score 2}}

            {{#if content}}
            - **Excerpt**:
            {{ content }}
            {{/if}}

            {{#if permalink}}
            You can view this content with: `read_note("{{ permalink }}")`
            Or explore its context with: `build_context("memory://{{ permalink }}")`
            {{else}}
            You can view this file with: `read_file("{{ file_path }}")`
            {{/if}}
        {{/dedent}}
        {{/if_cond}}
    {{/each}}

## Next Steps

You can:
- Refine your search: `search_notes("{{ query }} AND additional_term")`
- Exclude terms: `search_notes("{{ query }} NOT exclude_term")`
- View more results: `search_notes("{{ query }}", after_date=None)`
- Check recent activity: `recent_activity()`

## Synthesize and Capture Knowledge

Consider creating a new note that synthesizes what you've learned:

```python
await write_note(
    title="Synthesis of {{capitalize query}} Information",
    content='''
    # Synthesis of {{capitalize query}} Information
    
    ## Overview
    [Synthesis of the search results and your conversation]
    
    ## Key Insights
    [Summary of main points learned from these results]
    
    ## Observations
    - [insight] [Important observation from search results]
    - [connection] [How this connects to other topics]
    
    ## Relations
    - relates_to [[{{#if results.length}}{{#if results.0.title}}{{results.0.title}}{{else}}Related Topic{{/if}}{{else}}Related Topic{{/if}}]]
    - extends [[Another Relevant Topic]]
    '''
)
```

Remember that capturing synthesized knowledge is one of the most valuable features of Basic Memory.
{{else}}
    I couldn't find any results for this query.

    ## Opportunity to Capture Knowledge!

    This is an excellent opportunity to create new knowledge on this topic. Consider:

    ```python
    await write_note(
        title="{{capitalize query}}",
        content='''
        # {{capitalize query}}

        ## Overview
        [Summary of what we've discussed about {{ query }}]

        ## Observations
        - [category] [First observation about {{ query }}]
        - [category] [Second observation about {{ query }}]

        ## Relations
        - relates_to [[Other Relevant Topic]]
        '''
    )
    ```

    ## Other Suggestions
    - Try a different search term
    - Broaden your search criteria
    - Check recent activity with `recent_activity(timeframe="1w")`
