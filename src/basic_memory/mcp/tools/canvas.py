    """Create an Obsidian canvas file with the provided nodes and edges.

    This tool creates a .canvas file compatible with Obsidian's Canvas feature,
    allowing visualization of relationships between concepts or documents.

    For the full JSON Canvas 1.0 specification, see the 'spec://canvas' resource.

    Args:
        nodes: List of node objects following JSON Canvas 1.0 spec
        edges: List of edge objects following JSON Canvas 1.0 spec
        title: The title of the canvas (will be saved as title.canvas)
        folder: Folder path relative to project root where the canvas should be saved.
                Use forward slashes (/) as separators. Examples: "diagrams", "projects/2025", "visual/maps"
        project: Optional project name to create canvas in. If not provided, uses current active project.

    Returns:
        A summary of the created canvas file

    Important Notes:
    - When referencing files, use the exact file path as shown in Obsidian
      Example: "folder/Document Name.md" (not permalink format)
    - For file nodes, the "file" attribute must reference an existing file
    - Nodes require id, type, x, y, width, height properties
    - Edges require id, fromNode, toNode properties
    - Position nodes in a logical layout (x,y coordinates in pixels)
    - Use color attributes ("1"-"6" or hex) for visual organization

    Basic Structure:
    ```json
    {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "node1",
          "type": "file",  // Options: "file", "text", "link", "group"
          "file": "folder/Document.md",
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0,
          "width": 400,
          "height": 300
        }
      ],
      "edges": [
        {
          "id": "edge1",
          "fromNode": "node1",
          "toNode": "node2",
          "label": "connects to"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Examples:
        # Create canvas in current project
        canvas(nodes=[...], edges=[...], title="My Canvas", folder="diagrams")

        # Create canvas in specific project
        canvas(nodes=[...], edges=[...], title="My Canvas", folder="diagrams", project="work-project")
    """
    active_project = get_active_project(project)

    # Ensure path has .canvas extension
    file_title = title if title.endswith(".canvas") else f"{title}.canvas"
    file_path = f"{folder}/{file_title}"

    # Create canvas data structure
    canvas_data = {"nodes": nodes, "edges": edges}
