# Glama.ai Repository Rescan Guide

## How to Trigger Repository Updates on Glama.ai

Since Glama.ai automatically scans repositories, here are the most effective ways to ensure your recent improvements and Gold Status recognition are reflected in their platform.

## üéØ **Primary Methods to Trigger Rescan**

### 1. **Create a New Release** (Most Effective)
```bash
# Create and push a new git tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Gold Status Ready - Enterprise Production Ready"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Then create a GitHub release
# Go to: https://github.com/advanced-memory/advanced-memory/releases
# Click "Create a new release"
# Tag: v1.0.0
# Title: "1.0.0 Release - Gold Status Achievement"
# Description: Include changelog highlights and quality achievements
```

**Why this works**: New releases are high-priority triggers for repository scanners.

### 2. **Push Significant Commits**
```bash
# Make a meaningful commit with improvements
git add .
git commit -m "feat: achieve Gold Status recognition on Glama.ai with enterprise standards

- Complete enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline (multi-OS, multi-version testing)
