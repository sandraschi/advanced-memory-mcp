# Notion Integration Plan for Basic Memory

## Overview
Add comprehensive Notion import/export capabilities to Basic Memory, allowing users to migrate from Notion or work with Notion-exported content.

## Notion Export Formats
Notion supports several export formats:
- **HTML Export**: Most comprehensive, includes formatting, structure, and databases
- **Markdown Export**: Simpler format, good for basic content migration
- **CSV Export**: For database content only

## Tools to Implement

### 1. load_notion_export
**Purpose**: Import Notion HTML or Markdown exports into Basic Memory

**Features**:
- Parse Notion HTML exports with page hierarchy
- Handle Notion blocks (text, headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)
- Convert Notion databases to Basic Memory entities
- Preserve links and references between pages
- Handle nested page structures
- Support both individual page and workspace exports

**Input**: Path to Notion export directory or zip file
**Output**: Basic Memory entities with proper relations

### 2. export_notion_compatible
**Purpose**: Export Basic Memory content in Notion-compatible format

**Features**:
- Export as Markdown with Notion-compatible formatting
- Preserve entity relations as links
- Convert observations to Notion-style properties
- Generate frontmatter for metadata
- Support folder structure preservation

**Input**: Basic Memory entities to export
**Output**: Markdown files that can be imported into Notion

### 3. search_notion_vault
**Purpose**: Search through Notion export files

**Features**:
- Full-text search across HTML/Markdown exports
- Filter by page type, database, or custom properties
- Support Notion-specific search patterns
- Handle both local files and remote Notion exports

**Input**: Search query with optional filters
**Output**: Matching Notion pages/entities

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Import (load_notion_export)
1. Create HTML parser for Notion exports
2. Handle basic page structure and content blocks
3. Convert to Basic Memory entities
4. Add relation mapping for internal links

### Phase 2: Enhanced Export (export_notion_compatible)
1. Create Notion-compatible Markdown exporter
2. Handle entity relations and metadata
3. Support observation conversion

### Phase 3: Search Integration (search_notion_vault)
1. Implement file-based search for Notion exports
2. Add Notion-specific filtering options

## Technical Considerations

### HTML Parsing Challenges
- Notion HTML structure is complex with nested divs and classes
- Database views require special handling
- Block types need mapping to Markdown equivalents

### Link Resolution
- Internal Notion links need to be converted to Basic Memory permalinks
- External links should be preserved
- Database references need proper entity mapping

### Database Conversion
- Notion databases → Basic Memory entities with observations
- Properties → Entity metadata and observations
- Views → Filtered searches

## User Benefits
- **Migration Path**: Easy transition from Notion to Basic Memory
- **Hybrid Workflow**: Use both tools simultaneously
- **Data Preservation**: Maintain content structure and relations
- **Search Integration**: Find content across both systems

## Success Metrics
- Successful import of complex Notion workspaces
- Preservation of page hierarchy and links
- Accurate conversion of databases to entities
- Seamless re-import into Notion if needed

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium**: HTML parsing complexity may require iterative refinement
- **Low**: Markdown export is straightforward
- **Low**: Search functionality leverages existing patterns

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (core import functionality)
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 days (export capabilities)
- **Phase 3**: 1 day (search integration)
