# Research Orchestrator Guide ðŸ§ 

AI-guided research planning and workflow orchestration for comprehensive knowledge building.

## Overview

The `research_orchestrator` tool provides structured guidance to help Claude/Sonnet conduct thorough, systematic research and create well-linked knowledge bases. While the MCP server cannot directly control the AI client, this tool returns detailed research plans, methodologies, and step-by-step workflows that Claude can follow.

## Key Concept

**MCP Boundary**: The server provides *guidance and structure*, while Claude executes the research and creates notes. This creates a collaborative workflow where the tool provides the "conductor's score" and Claude performs the "symphony."

## Operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Research plan too broad"
**Solution**: Specify narrower scope or use `depth="focused"`
```python
await research_orchestrator.fn("research_plan", topic="quantum computing", parameters={"scope": "narrow"})
```

#### "Too many questions generated"
**Solution**: Use `depth="basic"` instead of `comprehensive`
```python
await research_orchestrator.fn("research_questions", topic="quantum computing", parameters={"depth": "basic"})
```

#### "Methodology doesn't fit"
**Solution**: Try different `topic_type`
```python
await research_orchestrator.fn("research_methodology", topic_type="academic")
```

### Getting Unstuck

#### Research Block
- Return to research plan overview
- Focus on unanswered questions
- Look for new angles or sources
