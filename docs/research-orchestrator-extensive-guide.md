## Core Philosophy

### MCP Boundary Innovation

Traditional AI research assistants can conduct independent web searches and create notes. However, MCP (Model Context Protocol) constrains the server from directly controlling the AI client. The Research Orchestrator solves this by providing **structured guidance** instead of direct commands.

**❌ Cannot**: Server directly commanding Claude to "search the web for quantum computing"
**✅ Can**: Server providing detailed research roadmap that Claude autonomously follows

### Structured Research Framework

The tool implements proven research methodologies from academic, technical, and business domains, adapted for AI-assisted knowledge building. Each operation returns actionable guidance that Claude interprets and executes systematically.

## Tool Operations
