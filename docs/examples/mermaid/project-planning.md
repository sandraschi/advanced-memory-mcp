# Project Alpha Planning

This note demonstrates how to use Mermaid diagrams for project planning and documentation.

## Project Overview

Project Alpha is a comprehensive initiative to modernize our data processing pipeline. This document outlines the planning, execution, and monitoring phases.

## Project Timeline

```mermaid
